## Introduction

This project contains:

* [Slides](slides/intro-slides.html) and [notes](pages/intro.html) for [a talk](http://www.thetrampery.com/legal-fundamentals-for-startups-with-francis-davey-talk-qa-and-surgery/) I gave at [Mother at the Trampery](http://www.thetrampery.com/) on 15 April 2014. I hope to publish some notes soon.

## The repository
The slides and notes are written in [markdown for pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html) and are converted using [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
