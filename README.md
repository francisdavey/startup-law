## Introduction

This project contains:

* [Slides](slides/intro-slides.html) and [very incomplete notes](pages/index.html) for a talk I have given a couple of times, most recently at [Fish Island Labs](http://www.barbican.org.uk/fishisland/).
* Guides on common company procedures:
    + [Transferring shares](guides/transferring-shares.html)
    + [Subdividing shares](guides/subdividing-share-capital.html)
    + [Changing a company's constitution](guides/changing-constitution.html)

## The repository
The slides and notes are written in [markdown for pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html) and are converted using [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
