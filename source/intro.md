# Business structures
For a startup intending to exit (by sale or IPO) and make capital gains in that way - a classic definition of "startup" - there is only one sensible business structure: the private company limited by shares.

## Social enterprises
I don't have time in the talk to discuss options for social enterprises, but there are far more of these:

- Company limited by guarantee
- Company limited by shares
- Industrial & Provident Society
- Charitable Incorporated Organization

### Community interest companies
A community interest company (CIC) is a restricted form of limited company (by guarantee or shares) the assets of which (and in some cases the profits of which) have to be retained for the community. A CIC cannot also be a charity. 

### Charities
A charity is not a corporate structure, it is something a corporation can be. Charities obey very strict rules concerning their objects (the purposes for which the charity may operate) and the use to which their finances are put. Charities themselves will generally not engage in extensive business activities, but there is no reason why they cannot own a subsidiary business entity.

Any of the following may be used for a charity:
- Company limited by guarantee
- Industrial & Provident Society
- Charitable Incorporated Organization

| Corporate form                       | Regulator          | Charitable regulator |
| Company limited by guarantee         | Companies House    | Charity Commission   |
| Industrial & Provident Society       | FCA                | FCA                  |
| Charitable Incorporated Organization | Charity Commission | Charity Commission                     |

# Contracts
# Employment
A lot of useful information can be found on the [ACAS website](http://www.acas.org.uk/). The most useful pages include:

- [Useful templates for letters, forms and checklists](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4161)

## Employee v contractor
- not a matter of choice (if it quacks like an employee)
- Useful [Employment Status Indicator](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/calcs/esi.htm), the result for which may be something you can rely on for tax/NICs/VAT purposes.
- The ESM (HMRC's [employment status manual](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/esmmanual/index.htm) has more detail than most people could possibly want.

| Right                         | Status   |
|-------------------------------+----------|
| Unfair dismissal              | Employee |
| Fixed-term worker rights      | Employee |
| Unlawful deduction from wages | Worker   |
| Part-time worker rights       | Worker   |
| National minimum wage         | Worker   |
| Working time regulations      | Worker         |

 'an individual who has entered into or works under (or, where the employment has ceased) worked under (a) a contract of employment, or (b) any other contract, whether express or implied, and (if it is express) whether oral or in writing, whereby the individual undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services for another party to the contract whose status is not by virtue of the contract that of a client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by the individual'.

###Directors
A company's directors are not necessarily employees of the company. The technical term is "officeholder" since they hold the "office" of director. However a director may be, and often is, an employee. Company secretaries will usually be treated as employees.

A company director's employment contract is known as a "service agreement". A company must keep a copy of every written service agreement (and a written memorandum - i.e. summary of - every service agreement that is not in writing).

###Employee shareholders
Introduced by section 31 of the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013. Various rights are lost:

- right to request flexible working (other than one made within 14 days of return from parental leave)
- right not to be unfairly dismissed
- right to claim a redundancy payment
- right to request to undertake study or training (s63D of the Employment Rights Act 1996)

Also a longer notice period of a return to work from maternity/paternity leave. Can't dsmiss someone because they refuse to become an employee shareholder. It is meant to be voluntary.

Requirements:

- the parties agree 
- shares with value of at least £2,000
- written statement of particulars of the status of employee shareholder
- employee advised by a "relevant independent adviser" (see under settlement agreements)
- the employee gives nothing back (eg money) in return except for entering the agreement to become an employee shareholder

Advantages to the employee:

- no income tax or NICs on the first £2,000 of shares
- no capital gains tax on disposal of the shares (up to £50,000)

## Eligibility to work
## Contract of employment

- statement of particulars of employment
- staff handbook
- policies
    
## Discrimination

- Equality Act 2010
- victimisation
- pregnancy

Example: at an interview an Irish girl wearing green was being interviewed by a panel. One interviewer made notes about each interviewee and gave them memorable labels. About this interviewee she wrote "green leprachaun". This proved very unfortuante when the notes were disclosed as part of a discrimination claim.

## Working Time
| Right                                        |            | opt-out? |
|----------------------------------------------+------------+----------|
| Hours per week                               |         48 | yes      |
| Consecutive hours in any 24-hour period      |         11 |          |
| Rest break (working day longer than 6 hours) | 20 minutes |          |
| Days off per week                            |          1 |          |
| Weeks leave per year                         |        5.6 | no       |
|                                              |            |          |


## Employment Rights
- redundancy pay
- right not to be unfairly dismissed

## Employee Share options
Problem. There will almost never be a convenient market for small quantities of a startup's shares, but they will still be treated as having a taxable value. An employee who is given shares by their employer will have to pay income tax on them but won't be able to realise the value of their shares at that time (if ever).

# Intellectual Property
# Confidentiality
The good news is that English law has developed a fairly common-sense law of confidentiality. If:

What this means in practical terms is that
