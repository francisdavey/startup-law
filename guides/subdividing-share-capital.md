# Subdividing Shares


## Motivation
Many company setup sites will create a private limited company with 100 shares of £1 each. There is nothing magic about these numbers - one share of one penny would be entirely possible for instance. I suspect that many people creating new companies to run a small business find 100 shares an easy number to think about. Each share represents 1% of the company. They and their co-founders are able to split the shares in easy percentage ratios.

For a growth startup 100 x £1 shares is not convenient. UK company law does not permit fractions of a share. You will soon find that you will want to play with fractional of a percentages of the company. 

Company law provides a straightforward way to do this. You may *subdivide* each share into a larger number of smaller value shares in such a way that the total nominal value of all the shares stays the same.

## HOW-TO checklist

* Check there is no restriction on the power to subdivide shares in the company's articles.
* Pass an ordinary members' resolution to subdivide the shares.
* Fill in [form SH02](http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/forms/generalForms/SH02_notice_of_consolidation_sub_division_redemption_of_a_shares_or_reconversion_of_stock_into_share.pdf).
* Send the completed SH02 to the registrar of companies within one month of the resolution.

### Example resolution

This example assumes that the company has 100 x £1 ordinary shares. Each share will be subdivided into 10,000 shares of 0.01p (one hundredth of a penny) each (10,000 x 0.01p = £1). The company will then have a million ordinary shares of 0.01p allowing greater flexibility.

The members (shareholders) of the company would then pass the following ordinary resolution:

> That each of the ordinary shares of £1 each in the present issued capital of the company be subdivided into 10,000 shares of 0.01p
