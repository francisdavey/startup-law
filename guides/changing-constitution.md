# Amending the company's constitution

## Motivation
You will sometimes want to change your company's constitution. For example, so that it better reflects how you work, or to build-in protections for founders and/or prospective investors.

## HOW-TO checklist

* Check that there are no "entrenched" provisions of your existing articles (i.e. provisions that require a stricter procedure to change - if so, you will need to comply with that procedure).
* Pass a special resolution to adopt the new articles.^[section 21]
* Send the following to Companies House within *15 days* of passing the resolution (in practice they will usually be sent together):
    * a copy of the special resolution^[section 30(1)]
    * a copy of the new articles^[section 26]

### Entrenched provisions
Provisions of a company's articles can be "entrenched"^[section 22]. This means that their is a harder procedure for changing them than simply using a special resolution. Entrenched provisions may still be changed by agreement of all the members of the company or by a court order.
