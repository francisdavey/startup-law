# Transferring shares

## Motivation
Transferring shares between members or to new members is a common transaction in a growth startup. 

Unlike the issuing of new shares, transferring shares may attract a tax known as Stamp Duty. Transfers where the price paid is Â£1,000 or less and some other transfers (such as between married couples or those in a civil partnership) are exempt. If stamp duty is payable, the transfer form will need to be "stamped" by HMRC.

## HOW-TO checklist

* **Check** what the articles (or other agreements such as any shareholders agreement) may say about transfer
    + If you find that there are pre-emption rights or permission is needed then obtain any waivers and permissions required.
* Existing shareholder
    + Complete and sign share transfer form.
        + for fully paid up shares: J30 (Inform Direct have a [useful guide](http://www.informdirect.co.uk/shares/how-to-complete-a-stock-transfer-form-in-10-steps/) to filling it in)
        + for unpaid or partially paid shares: J10 (see [Inform Direct's guide](http://www.informdirect.co.uk/shares/form-j10-transfer-unpaid-shares/))
    + Give the transfer form to the new shareholder along with the old share certificates.
* New shareholder: 
    + if the form is J10, sign it also
    + if stamp duty is due, have the transfer form stamped by HMRC
    + give the transfer form and old certificates to the company.
* Company secretary: check paperwork:
    + Are the share certificates correct? Do the number of shares transferred by the form match the share certificates? Is the transferor registered with those shares and is their name and address correct?
    + Are the shares fully paid up or only partially paid? Check that the correct form (J30 or J10) has been used.
    + If a J10 has been used, has it been signed by the transferee(s) as well as the transferor(s) 
    + Where someone else is signing on behalf of the transferor, check that their form of authority is correct.
* Board: check whether the board must approve the transfer.
    + If the board's approval is necessary, pass a resolution to approve the transfer
* Company Secretary:
    + Cancel the old share certificates.
    + Issue new share certificates to the new shareholder.
    + Update the register of members (and the register of share transfers if the company keeps on).
