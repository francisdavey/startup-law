    <h1 id="business-structures">Business structures</h1>
    <p>For a startup intending to exit (by sale or IPO) and make capital gains in that way - a classic definition of &quot;startup&quot; - there is only one sensible business structure: the private company limited by shares.</p>
    <h2 id="social-enterprises">Social enterprises</h2>
    <p>I don't have time in the talk to discuss options for social enterprises, but there are far more of these:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Company limited by guarantee</li>
    <li>Company limited by shares</li>
    <li>Industrial &amp; Provident Society</li>
    <li>Charitable Incorporated Organization</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="community-interest-companies">Community interest companies</h3>
    <p>A community interest company (CIC) is a restricted form of limited company (by guarantee or shares) the assets of which (and in some cases the profits of which) have to be retained for the community. A CIC cannot also be a charity.</p>
    <h3 id="charities">Charities</h3>
    <p>A charity is not a corporate structure, it is something a corporation can be. Charities obey very strict rules concerning their objects (the purposes for which the charity may operate) and the use to which their finances are put. Charities themselves will generally not engage in extensive business activities, but there is no reason why they cannot own a subsidiary business entity.</p>
    <p>Any of the following may be used for a charity: - Company limited by guarantee - Industrial &amp; Provident Society - Charitable Incorporated Organization</p>
    <p>Corporate form | Regulator | Charitable regulator |<br />Company limited by guarantee | Companies House | Charity Commission |<br />Industrial &amp; Provident Society | FCA | FCA |<br />Charitable Incorporated Organization | Charity Commission | Charity Commission |</p>

    <h2 id="employment-status-employee-v-worker-v-contractor">Employment status (employee v worker v contractor)</h2>
    <p>The law makes a broad distinction between people who work for you under an employment contract (employees) and those who do not -- often called &quot;contractors. In some situations (particularly for employment rights) there is a third class of individual the &quot;worker&quot;, someone who works for you personally but is not an employee. This means we end up with three categories.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>employees</li>
    <li>workers who are not employees</li>
    <li>other self-employed contractors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The law cares most about what the person is <em>doing</em> rather than what you call them. In other words if your relationship with someone quacks like an employment relationship it probably is. This means that simply labelling one of your employees a self-employed contractor won't automatically turn them into one. Although that label might be one small factor that could push the relationship over the line if it was doubtful which side of the line it fell.</p>
    <p>For tax purposes there is a Useful <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/calcs/esi.htm">Employment Status Indicator</a>, the result for which may be something you can rely on for tax/NICs/VAT purposes, assuming you answer the questions it asks correctly.</p>
    <h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
    <p>Status matters for three main reasons:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>tax</em> (income tax and national insurance)</li>
    <li><em>immigration</em>: someone may be entitled to work in the UK as a self-employed individual but not as an employee</li>
    <li><em>employment rights</em>: there are different employment rights for employees, workers and self-employed who are not workers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="employees">Employees</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately there is no conclusive test for which category someone falls into. Instead the courts have developed a series of &quot;tests&quot;.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The ESM (HMRC's <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/esmmanual/index.htm">employment status manual</a> has more detail than most people could possibly want.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="workers">Workers</h3>
    <p>'an individual who has entered into or works under (or, where the employment has ceased) worked under (a) a contract of employment, or (b) any other contract, whether express or implied, and (if it is express) whether oral or in writing, whereby the individual undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services for another party to the contract whose status is not by virtue of the contract that of a client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by the individual'.</p>

    <h3 id="directors">Directors</h3>
    <p>A company's directors are not necessarily employees of the company. The technical term is &quot;officeholder&quot; since they hold the &quot;office&quot; of director. However a director may be, and often is, an employee. Company secretaries will usually be treated as employees.</p>
    <p>A company director's employment contract is known as a &quot;service agreement&quot;. A company must keep a copy of every written service agreement (and a written memorandum - i.e. summary of - every service agreement that is not in writing).</p>
    <h3 id="employee-shareholders">Employee shareholders</h3>
    <p>Introduced by section 31 of the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013. Various rights are lost:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>right to request flexible working (other than one made within 14 days of return from parental leave)</li>
    <li>right not to be unfairly dismissed</li>
    <li>right to claim a redundancy payment</li>
    <li>right to request to undertake study or training (s63D of the Employment Rights Act 1996)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also a longer notice period of a return to work from maternity/paternity leave. Can't dsmiss someone because they refuse to become an employee shareholder. It is meant to be voluntary.</p>
    <p>Requirements:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the parties agree</li>
    <li>shares with value of at least £2,000</li>
    <li>written statement of particulars of the status of employee shareholder</li>
    <li>employee advised by a &quot;relevant independent adviser&quot; (see under settlement agreements)</li>
    <li>the employee gives nothing back (eg money) in return except for entering the agreement to become an employee shareholder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Advantages to the employee:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>no income tax or NICs on the first £2,000 of shares</li>
    <li>no capital gains tax on disposal of the shares (up to £50,000)</li>

    <p>Example: at an interview an Irish girl wearing green was being interviewed by a panel. One interviewer made notes about each interviewee and gave them memorable labels. About this interviewee she wrote &quot;green leprachaun&quot;. This proved very unfortuante when the notes were disclosed as part of a discrimination claim.</p>

    <h2 id="employee-share-options">Employee Share options</h2>
    <p>Problem. There will almost never be a convenient market for small quantities of a startup's shares, but they will still be treated as having a taxable value. An employee who is given shares by their employer will have to pay income tax on them but won't be able to realise the value of their shares at that time (if ever).</p>
    <h1 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h1>
    <p>The phrase &quot;intellectual property&quot; does not have a single precise meaning. In fact some people <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html">strongly object</a> to the term for that reason.</p>
    <p>(perhaps something about non-ownership of ideas etc)</p>
    <p>The rights a startup is most likely to be concerned with are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>copyright</li>
    <li>trademarks</li>
    <li>design rights</li>
    <li>database right</li>
    <li>patents</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these rights are either national or in some cases cover multi-national regions (eg there is a Community Trade Mark that covers the EU). This means that startups operating internationally will have to think carefully about the countries in which they register. Unfortunately since each jurisdiction will charge its own fees, international protection can become very expensive.</p>
    <h2 id="registering-rights">Registering rights</h2>
    <p>Some rights only exist if you register them. This will almost always mean fees (to the registry) and legal or administrative costs. Registerable rights tend to be a little stronger than unregistered rights because, as a rule of thumb, a registered right can be infringed without unwittingly (you are assumed to have read the registers) whereas an unregistered right may only be infringed deliberately.</p>
    <p>Example: if you happen to write a poem that is the same as or very similar to someone else's poem protected by copyright (an unregistered right) but the similarities are accidental and you are not infringing, although you may have to do some work to convince the judge that you didn't in fact copy. On the other hand if you build a product using someone else's patented invention of which you were unaware you do infringe.</p>

    <p>Patents protect inventions. To be protected an invention must be:[^patent-euonly] [^patent-euonly]: These definitions apply to most European countries (those that are part of the European Patent Convention) but not to others and in particular not to the US which has very similar but different rules.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>new (no-one must have published or used it before)</li>
    <li>not obvious: someone &quot;skilled in the art&quot; (that is someone with knowledge of and experience in the particular field of the invention) must not think it is obvious</li>
    <li>capable of industrial application: it must be possible either to use it in industry or to manufacture it industrially</li>
    <li>not excluded</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Excluded inventions include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>scientific and mathematical discoveries, theories and methods</li>
    <li>literary, dramatic, mustical or artistic works<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></li>
    <li>business methods and ways of playing games or performing mental acts</li>
    <li>computer programs <em>as such</em> (although in practice computer programs are patented, for example by claiming that a computer running the program is not a computer program <em>as such</em><sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Patents are a national right. In other words you would need to apply for a different patent in each country where you wanted to protect your invention. There are various ways to simplify the process. In particular it is possible to apply through the European Patent Office for a set of patents covering multiple European countries simultaneously. Probably in 2015 there will be a single patent avaiable to cover most of the EU.</p>
