    <h1 id="business-structures">Business structures</h1>
    <p>For a startup intending to exit (by sale or IPO) and make capital gains in that way - a classic definition of &quot;startup&quot; - there is only one sensible business structure: the private company limited by shares.</p>
    <h2 id="social-enterprises">Social enterprises</h2>
    <p>I don't have time in the talk to discuss options for social enterprises, but there are far more of these:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Company limited by guarantee</li>
    <li>Company limited by shares</li>
    <li>Industrial &amp; Provident Society</li>
    <li>Charitable Incorporated Organization</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="community-interest-companies">Community interest companies</h3>
    <p>A community interest company (CIC) is a restricted form of limited company (by guarantee or shares) the assets of which (and in some cases the profits of which) have to be retained for the community. A CIC cannot also be a charity.</p>
    <h3 id="charities">Charities</h3>
    <p>A charity is not a corporate structure, it is something a corporation can be. Charities obey very strict rules concerning their objects (the purposes for which the charity may operate) and the use to which their finances are put. Charities themselves will generally not engage in extensive business activities, but there is no reason why they cannot own a subsidiary business entity.</p>
    <p>Any of the following may be used for a charity: - Company limited by guarantee - Industrial &amp; Provident Society - Charitable Incorporated Organization</p>
    <p>Corporate form | Regulator | Charitable regulator |<br />Company limited by guarantee | Companies House | Charity Commission |<br />Industrial &amp; Provident Society | FCA | FCA |<br />Charitable Incorporated Organization | Charity Commission | Charity Commission |</p>

    <p>Example: at an interview an Irish girl wearing green was being interviewed by a panel. One interviewer made notes about each interviewee and gave them memorable labels. About this interviewee she wrote &quot;green leprachaun&quot;. This proved very unfortuante when the notes were disclosed as part of a discrimination claim.</p>

    <h2 id="employee-share-options">Employee Share options</h2>
    <p>Problem. There will almost never be a convenient market for small quantities of a startup's shares, but they will still be treated as having a taxable value. An employee who is given shares by their employer will have to pay income tax on them but won't be able to realise the value of their shares at that time (if ever).</p>
